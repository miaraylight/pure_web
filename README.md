# Pure WEB
> In this repository you can find code samples for creating various interfaces, functional elements and web pages that do not use frameworks or other libraries.

> Each project in this repository can be used as a learning resource for beginner developers (as it was for me) who want to learn the basics of web development.

> All of the projects here are simple yet effective and can be a great starting point for further skill development.
